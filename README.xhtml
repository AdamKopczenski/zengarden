    <h1>Zen Garden readme file</h1>
    <p>Zen Garden is a game that I, Adam Kopczenski, made up that uses a Zendo set. The purpose of this little Ruby project is to help me make illustrations that I'll need when I publish it. I cannot draw to save my life, so it really is just easier to write a whole coding project to make this happen.</p>
    <h2>The purpose of this code</h2>
    <p>Cabinet projection is a specific type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_projection">oblique projection</a>, a simple enough setn of rules that makes passable drawings of three-dimensional objects. What I'm aiming for here is a tool that'll turn a description of a board with pieces on it into an SVG image.</p>
    <h2>Types of coordinates</h2>
    <p>Because I'm playing with pieces on a grid, and polygons in space, and shapes on an SVG canvas, I'm going to wind up using the word "coordinates" to refer to three totally separate systems. Here they are:</p>
    <p><b>Logical coordinates</b> refer to locations on a Zen Garden board. Things like "There is an upright blue rectangle piece at e3.</p>
